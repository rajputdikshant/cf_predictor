# Codeforces Rank Predictor üèÜ

A machine learning-powered web application that predicts your future Codeforces rank based on your current performance, activity patterns, and problem-solving history.

## üìã Overview

This project uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze your Codeforces profile and predict your potential rank progression over different time periods (1 month, 2 months, or 1 year). The system considers multiple factors including your current rating, problem-solving patterns, contest participation, and topic expertise to provide accurate predictions.

## ‚ú® Features

- **üéØ Smart Rank Prediction**: Predicts your future Codeforces rank using machine learning models
- **üìä Interactive Visualizations**: Beautiful charts showing your rank progression over time
- **‚è∞ Multiple Timelines**: Choose between 1 month, 2 months, or 1 year predictions
- **üìà Historical Analysis**: Analyzes your past performance to understand growth patterns
- **üè∑Ô∏è Topic Analysis**: Tracks your expertise across different algorithm topics
- **üé® Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface built with Bootstrap 5 and Chart.js
- **üì± Mobile Friendly**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. Data Collection
The application fetches your data from Codeforces API:
- **User Information**: Current rating, max rating, rank
- **Contest History**: All participated contests and ratings
- **Submission History**: All problem submissions and their verdicts
- **Problem Tags**: Algorithm topics you've solved

### 2. Feature Engineering
The system extracts meaningful features from your data:
- Current and maximum ratings
- Number of contests participated
- Total problems solved
- Topic-wise problem distribution (18 different algorithm topics)
- Activity patterns (problems per month, contests per month)

### 3. Machine Learning Prediction
The prediction model uses:
- **XGBoost Regression**: Trained on historical Codeforces data
- **Adaptive Growth Factors**: Different growth rates based on current rating level
- **Activity Bonuses**: Rewards for consistent problem-solving and contest participation
- **Topic Progression**: Simulates improvement in different algorithm areas

### 4. Rank Calculation
Predictions are mapped to Codeforces ranks:
- **Newbie**: 0-1199
- **Pupil**: 1200-1399
- **Specialist**: 1400-1599
- **Expert**: 1600-1899
- **Candidate Master**: 1900-2099
- **Master**: 2100-2299
- **International Master**: 2300-2399
- **Grandmaster**: 2400-2599
- **International Grandmaster**: 2600-2999
- **Legendary Grandmaster**: 3000+
